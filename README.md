This notebook contains commonly used algorithms for ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest. It can be used in the contest as a guideline and helper when implementing the algorithms described here.

## Motivation

As a means of preparing myself, and also to keep track of my studies, I am writing this notebook with implementations done by me during my preparations for the ICPC.

I am also distributing this, so that other participants may benefit from my work and studies.
